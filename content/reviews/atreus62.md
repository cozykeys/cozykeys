<br />

Here is my review of the Atreus62 keyboard after using it as a daily driver for
6 weeks.

<br />

### Technical details

- Gateron red switches
- Cherry Profile PBT keycaps (EnjoyPBT & Gateron blanks)

### Pros

- The layout is very comfortable for the most part
    - I love columnar stagger and having multiple keys to press with my thumbs
    - Only two keys are uncomfortable to press
- Great for gaming
    - The left hand can comfortably rest on WASD
    - Easy to play games with very little to no remapping
- Compact
    - Previous ergonomic keyboards I used such as the Kinesis Advantage are big
      and hard to travel with
    - Similar size to a standard 60%
    - Practical to throw in a backpack
    - Easy to have a sleeve made
- QMK firmware
    - Fully programmable
    - One of my biggest complaints about the Kinesis is that is runs proprietary
      fimware and I was too lazy to replace the PCB with a stapleton and teensy
    - I can choose what to put on the top layer and put other keys such as arrows
      and curly braces on lower layers
- Nice sound and aesthetic
  - The size and hallowness of the advantage makes it sound bad, even after I
    installed some dampening foam on the inside
  - This board sounds and doesn't look as crazy

### Cons

- Inner-most thumb keys
    - The two 1.5u thumb keys are positioned poorly
    - Don't need to be 1.5u, makes the profile angle sideways which is less
      comfortable

### Overall

- Highly recommended for those looking for a compact, ergonomic option that can
  be purchased pre-assembled
- For those more adventurous and willing to hand-wire their own keyboard, I
  would recommend something like the [Speedo](/keyboards/speedo/), which I have
  since designed and improves on the thumb clusters

# About

## Who Am I?

My name is Paul and I'm a software engineer, currently working as a server
programmer at Blizzard.

Over the past few years, designing and building mechanical keyboards has become
one of my main hobbies. Some of my projects up to this point have been:

- Modding a Kinesis Advantage2 and replacing the switches
- Building an Iris with full LED and RGB support
- Building a Preonic
- Designing the Speedo hand-wired keyboard
- Designing the Bloomer keyboard with a PCB

## What is CozyKeys?

CozyKeys is the website I've created so that I have a place to organize my
projects and publish my content!

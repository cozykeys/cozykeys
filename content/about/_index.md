# About

Over the past few years, mechanical keyboards have become one of my main
hobbies. My projects have included replacing the switches in a Kinesis
Advantage2, building keyboards such as the Iris and Preonic from kits, and more
recently designing and building my own custom keyboards.

As a software engineer, it's been fun to tackle keyboard design problems with
code and it's also given me the opportunity to explore electronics, which I
only briefly learned about while going to school for computer science.

I finally decided to create CozyKeys so that I would have a place to gather all
of my builds, project updates, pictures, etc.

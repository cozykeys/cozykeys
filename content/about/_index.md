# About

## Who Am I?

My name is Paul and I'm a software engineer, currently working as a tools
programmer for the game Heroes of the Storm at Blizzard.

Over the past few years, mechanical keyboards have become one of my main
hobbies. Some of my projects up to this point have been:

- Modding a Kinesis Advantage2 and replacing the switches
- Building an Iris with full LED and RGB support
- Building a Preonic
- Designing the Speedo hand-wired keyboard
- Designing the Bloomer keyboard with a PCB

## What is CozyKeys?

CozyKeys is the brand that I have created as a way to organize my projects and
the CozyKeys website provides a place where I can centralize and organize the
content that I want to publish!

# Speedo

The Speedo is a 66-key ergonomic keyboard. It is heavily inspired by the Atreus
and Atreus62 but introduces a few improvements.

## Thumb Clusters

One of the most common complaints about the Atreus(62) is the location of the
inner-most thumb keys. The Speedo takes the two inner-most thumb keys from each
side and places them in a curved arc, making them easier to press via a natural
thumb movement.

## Extra Dedicated Keys

Rather than waste the space in the middle of the board, the Speedo adds 4 extra
keys in the center which can serve a few different purposes.

For some users, having dedicated arrow keys or home, end, page up, and page
down can be useful. For others, having programmable macro keys, which is
possible with QMK firmware, adds utility.

Personally, I like having the extra keys as an area to showcase artisan
keycaps. Artisans can add personality to a keyboard but they are generally less
comfortable to press so having them on commonly pressed keys is not ideal. The
4 additional keys are symmetrical and centrally located, making them a great
place to add some flair to the keyboard.
 
## Open Source

As with all of the CozyKeys projects, the Speedo is and will remain completely
open source. This means that the same design files I use to get the parts
manufactured will be available on GitHub.

The goal behind this is to allow other enthusiasts to fork and modify the
designs to their own liking. Pull requests are also happily accepted!

I had a few weeks in which I was waiting for the supplies to arrive in the mail
for the rev2 Bloomer keyboards. In this time, I decided to rethink how I'm
sharing my content.

In the past, I've written blog posts on a personal website, posted build logs
to imgur and GitHub gists, shared photos on Reddit, and recently started
posting updates on Keebtalk. In summary, there has been no rhyme or reason to
the way in which I've shared the progress on my personal projects.

Having wanted to learn more about *Hugo*, a static website generator built in
the *Go* programming language, I decided that I should come up with a brand
name to encompass my projects and publish a website in which I could centralize
the content that I share.

So, welcome to *CozyKeys*!

My goal with this site and the next step in my mechanical keyboard journey in
general is to add a bit more polish and professionalism to my projects. So far
I have:

* Designed the Speedo, a keyboard that is only accessible to those willing to
  get the case laser cut and subsequently handwire the components
* Designed the Bloomer (Formerly known as the Ergo87/Atreus87), a keyboard that
  has a PCB but is not yet available for purchase

The next step in my journey is to take a project to the point where I can offer
it as a reasonable product to the community. That said, I would still like to
provide other value in ways such as publishing honest product reviews and build
logs for other vendors' keyboard that I assemble.

I'm looking forward to having a place and a name under which to publish my
content and I'm hoping that you find it useful!
